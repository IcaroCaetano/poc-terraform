# Terraform POC â€“ EC2 Instance with Security Groups

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision an AWS EC2 instance with an associated Security Group.
The Security Group allows SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) access, making it possible to connect to the instance and host a basic web application.
